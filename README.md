# Database-MySql-database
Using Python connector to connect to workbench database
# Overview


I used python to intertact with the databse. I imported the python library mysql.connector and used that to connect to the database. I used the code to insert update create and delete entries in the database 

I wrote this piece of software to learn how python can intertacts with databases and techniques that i can use to enter data into databases like using for loops to insert large amounts of data into a database.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of how created the Relational Database.}
